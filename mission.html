                <p>Driven by boundless dreams, ARC is committed to building a global hub that ignites the passion
                    for research. We empower professors to transform visions into reality and illuminate pathways for
                    students to shape their futures.</p>
                <p>Here, there are no barriers to resources or boundaries of ideas—only a united pursuit of excellence.
                    We believe that true research should belong to everyone with talent and dreams. By integrating
                    global resources and optimizing collaboration, we ensure every researcher finds their ideal partners
                    and directions here.</p>
                <p>Looking ahead, our ultimate vision is to create a boundaryless Cloud Academy, offering top-tier
                    research experiences to talented individuals worldwide and driving humanity's breakthroughs in
                    knowledge.</p>

                </header>
                <p>At ARC, we believe that research should be driven by talent and curiosity, not by financial
                    constraints. Our mission is to create a truly accessible, boundaryless research ecosystem where
                    every aspiring scholar—regardless of background—can contribute to the advancement of knowledge. To
                    turn this vision into reality, we rely on the generosity of donors who share our commitment to
                    empowering the next generation of researchers.</p>

                    <dd>
                        <p>Behind every breakthrough lies an ecosystem that connects minds, fosters ideas, and
                            streamlines coordination. Your support enables us to cover essential operational
                            costs—maintaining secure servers, facilitating seamless researcher-student matching,
                            scheduling interviews, and ensuring that every promising project gets the organizational
                            support it needs. These foundational structures are the backbone of iDreamer, allowing us to
                            operate efficiently while keeping access open to all.

                    <dd>
                        <p>Talent should never be hindered by financial barriers. We reserve a portion of our donations
                            to exempt outstanding students from operational fees, ensuring that those with the strongest
                            potential receive the opportunities they deserve. Through our fellowship program, these
                            exceptional students are not only relieved of costs but are actively supported—receiving
                            mentorship, guidance, and resources to elevate their research ambitions. Your contribution
                            directly fuels the success of the brightest minds, giving them the freedom to focus entirely
                            on innovation.

                        <p>Beyond individual students, we aim to drive large-scale impact by fostering research
                            development across institutions. With additional funds, we will establish grants to support
                            college research initiatives, strengthening the foundation of academic discovery in the U.S.
                            across multiple disciplines. These grants will empower students and institutions alike,
                            bridging the gap between ambition and execution, and ensuring that promising ideas translate
                            into meaningful progress.

                    Every donation to ARC is an investment in the future of research—a future where access,
                    opportunity, and collaboration are not dictated by financial privilege but by the sheer power of
                    intellect and vision. Together, we can ignite the next generation of discoveries and transform the
                    landscape of global knowledge.
